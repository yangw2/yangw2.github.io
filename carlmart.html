                        Carlmart is designed to reduce waste by enabling people to buy and sell used items. 
                        It promotes sustainability by encouraging second-hand purchases and making affordable shopping accessible to everyone.

                    <p class="final three requirements">
                        For our project, we decided that the final three requirements would be a Buy Page, Shopping Cart page, and Sell Page.
The Buy Page will serve as the main page of the website, and enable users to browse and purchase items. Having a dedicated buy page will allow users to navigate our platform and browse items more easily.
A Shopping Cart Page is important because it allows users to store a list of items they are interested in purchasing instead of having to buy each item separately.
A Sell Page will allow users to upload items they are trying to sell to our website. This is where users can upload a picture and description of the item as well as their information.
                    </p>
                    <p class="addressing three requirements">
                        The WACK team chose a buy page, shopping cart page, and sell page for our final three requirements. 
For my prototype I made a dedicated page for each of our three chosen requirements. This addresses our team's final three requirements because it has the corresponding pages that we chose. 
I included elements that I expected these pages to have, like payment type for the sell page, and a filter button for the buy page.

                    <p class="description of UX process">
                        Our team focused on fictional inquiry interviews for our UX research process. We decided that fictional inquiry would allow us to best find the information we are looking for and design our website based on what stakeholders like. 
Each of our team members conducted a fictional inquiry interview with different stakeholders and we used the information from two of the interviews to create our codebook and final three requirements. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="description of analysis process">
                        Our team's analysis process consisted of six steps. Initial axial coding, affinity diagram, creating a codebook, axial coding with our codebook, consensus building, and requirements generation. The axial coding consisted of analyzing transcripts from our interview. 
We split into two groups consisting of Colin and Wesley, and Sho and Khizar, created an affinity diagram based on themes we saw in the transcripts, and made a consensus on each of our codebooks.
