                        <p><strong>Created by:</strong> Colin James, Khizar Qureshi, Sho Tanaka, and Wesley Yang.</p>
        
        <p>
          Carlmart is designed to reduce waste by enabling people to buy and sell used items. It promotes sustainability by encouraging second-hand purchases and making affordable shopping accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Results from UX Evaluation</h4>
        <h5>What Worked</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The layout of the buy page was simple and effective.</li>
          <li>Navigation to other pages was appreciated.</li>
          <li>The color scheme and overall layout made information easy to find.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>What Needed Improvement</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a back button to allow users to return to previous pages.</li>
          <li>Improve the intuitiveness of the sell page icon.</li>
          <li>Allow users to see past purchases and currently listed items.</li>
          <li>Add a rating system for items to indicate quality.</li>
          <li>Label the filter button clearly.</li>
          <li>Enable users to remove items from the shopping cart.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>How the Prototype Improved Based on UX Evaluations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a profile page to show personal information, previous purchases, and listed items.</li>
          <li>Enabled navigation to the sell page from the profile page.</li>
          <li>Included a rating system to display the condition of items.</li>
          <li>Added back buttons for easier navigation to the main buy page.</li>
          <li>Provided a clear label for the filter button.</li>
          <li>Added a button to remove items from the shopping cart.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>UX Evaluation Tasks</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Buy Page:</strong> Users scrolled through items, used the filter button, attempted to buy an item, and simulated a search. They also set a price range filter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation:</strong> Users tried to locate the sign in, shopping cart, and sell pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sign In Page:</strong> Users attempted to sign in or create an account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sell Page:</strong> Users simulated listing an item, including entering personal info (name, email) and uploading images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shopping Cart:</strong> Users reviewed items added to the cart and attempted to place an order.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>UX Evaluation Process</h4>
        <p>
          I used the think-aloud protocol. Two juniors were interviewed concurrently and took turns performing tasks on the website—spending roughly 5 minutes per page. They described their actions and thoughts throughout the process. At the end, they provided an overall review of their experience.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Substantiated Results from UX Evaluation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>“Oh so this is a tab filter, I don't like this design” – 2:56</li>
          <li>“I clicked on the shopping cart, but I don’t know how to get back” – 5:06</li>
          <li>“I don't like the icon for the profile” – 8:10</li>
          <li>“You should make a go back page like it's very difficult to go back.” – 9:04</li>
          <li>“People submit an item to sell, but sometimes forget if they submitted it, so adding a history would be helpful” – 10:30</li>
          <li>“I don’t want to put in my credit card” – 15:01</li>
          <li>“An edit button to remove items you don’t want in your cart” – 19:28</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Future Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Address payment challenges—explore integration with third-party payment systems (e.g., Venmo) or enable on-site transactions. Further user testing with actual transactions will help refine this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design a version for desktop to improve accessibility across multiple devices.
          </li>
        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Final Three Requirements:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            For our project, we decided that the final three requirements would be a Buy Page, Shopping Cart page, and Sell Page.
The Buy Page will serve as the main page of the website, and enable users to browse and purchase items. Having a dedicated buy page will allow users to navigate our platform and browse items more easily.
A Shopping Cart Page is important because it allows users to store a list of items they are interested in purchasing instead of having to buy each item separately.
A Sell Page will allow users to upload items they are trying to sell to our website. This is where users can upload a picture and description of the item as well as their information.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Addressing Requirements:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The WACK team chose a buy page, shopping cart page, and sell page for our final three requirements. 
For my prototype I made a dedicated page for each of our three chosen requirements. This addresses our team's final three requirements because it has the corresponding pages that we chose. 
I included elements that I expected these pages to have, like payment type for the sell page, and a filter button for the buy page.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>UX Process:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Our team focused on fictional inquiry interviews for our UX research process. We decided that fictional inquiry would allow us to best find the information we are looking for and design our website based on what stakeholders like. 
Each of our team members conducted a fictional inquiry interview with different stakeholders and we used the information from two of the interviews to create our codebook and final three requirements. 

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Analysis Process:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Our team's analysis process consisted of six steps. Initial axial coding, affinity diagram, creating a codebook, axial coding with our codebook, consensus building, and requirements generation. The axial coding consisted of analyzing transcripts from our interview. 
We split into two groups consisting of Colin and Wesley, and Sho and Khizar, created an affinity diagram based on themes we saw in the transcripts, and made a consensus on each of our codebooks.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Interaction Flow:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Navigate from Buy Page to Sell Page via the profile button.</li>
                            <li>Navigate from Buy Page to Shopping Cart via the shopping cart button.</li>
                            <li>Open filters using the triangle button on the Buy Page.</li>
                            <li>Access Login Page via the “Sign in or Register” link.</li>
                        </ul>
