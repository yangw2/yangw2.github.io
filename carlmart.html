                        <p><strong>Results from UX evaluation</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            What worked
                            - Layout of the buy page was simple and worked well. 
                            - They liked the navigation to other pages
                            - Color scheme and layout of the pages were simple but easy to find information

                            What needed improvement
                            - Need to add a back button that would allow users to go back to previous pages
                            - Sell page icon was not intuitive
                            - They wanted to be able to see past purchases and items that they have listed currently
                            - Rating system for items, so buyers can see the quality of the item.
                            - Label the filter button
                            - Cant remove items from shopping cart
                            
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>How the prototype improved based on UX evaluations</strong></p>
                        <p>
                           - I created a profile page to allow users to see personal information like previous purchases and items they currently have listed to sell. 
                           - Users will be able to navigate to the sell page from the profile page
                           - Included a rating system for the item which would allow users to see the condition of an item.
                           - Included back buttons that would allow users to navigate back to the main buy page
                           - Included a label for the filter, which allows users to see differentiate this button and the next page button
                           - Added a button to remove items from shopping cart
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>UX evaluation tasks</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            - For the evaluation tasks, I had people test each page, acting as if they were actually buying or trying to sell an item
- For the buy page, I had users scroll through items, try the filter button, try to buy an item, and simulate searching for an item. I also had users try and set a filter for the price range of the items they are looking for.
- From the buy page I would have users try to find the sign in page, shopping cart page, and the sell page. 
-For the sign in page, I had users try to sign in or create an account
-For the sell page, I had users simulate trying to add an item they would like to sell. This includes adding personal info, like name and email, and adding images of the item.
- For the shopping cart, I had users scroll through and see what items they had previously added to cart, and then try and place an order.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>UX evaluation process</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            For the UX evaluation process I chose think aloud. I performed an interview with two juniors at the same time and had them take turns performing certain tasks on the website. 
                            I had them spend roughly 5 minutes on each page, while speaking aloud what they were doing and what thoughts they had. 
                            At the end of the interview I had them give an overview of their thoughts and experience using Carlmart, and what they liked and disliked about my application.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Substantiated results from UX evaluation</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            Quotes
“Oh so this is a tab filter, I don't like this design” 2:56
“I clicked on the shopping cart, but I don’t know how to get back” 5:06
“I dont like the icon for the icon for the profile” 8:10
“you should make a go back page like it's very difficult to go back.” 9:04
“People submit an item to sell, but sometimes forget if they submitted it, so adding a history would be helpful” 10:30
“I don’t want to put in my credit card” 15:01
“An edit button to remove items you don’t want in your cart” 19:28

                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Future steps</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One of the biggest challenges for this website is payment, specifically how items would be paid for and how users would exchange items. Payment would not work on this app because users would either have to use another third party payment method like venmo, or somehow have payment be allowed on our website. This is something that would be better to test with actual users, and having a small number of users actually test this would give me a lot of useful information that I would be able to use to determine future steps for the application. 
                                From the UX evaluation for my prototype, knowing how delivery and payment works is obviously important, so this is something that I would like to include in my future steps if possible.
                                I also designed my application for a mobile device, so being able to design a version for computers would be nice since it would allow accessibility to users on multiple types of devices.

                        <p><strong>Final Three Requirements:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            For our project, we decided that the final three requirements would be a Buy Page, Shopping Cart page, and Sell Page.
The Buy Page will serve as the main page of the website, and enable users to browse and purchase items. Having a dedicated buy page will allow users to navigate our platform and browse items more easily.
A Shopping Cart Page is important because it allows users to store a list of items they are interested in purchasing instead of having to buy each item separately.
A Sell Page will allow users to upload items they are trying to sell to our website. This is where users can upload a picture and description of the item as well as their information.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Addressing Requirements:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            The WACK team chose a buy page, shopping cart page, and sell page for our final three requirements. 
For my prototype I made a dedicated page for each of our three chosen requirements. This addresses our team's final three requirements because it has the corresponding pages that we chose. 
I included elements that I expected these pages to have, like payment type for the sell page, and a filter button for the buy page.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>UX Process:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Our team focused on fictional inquiry interviews for our UX research process. We decided that fictional inquiry would allow us to best find the information we are looking for and design our website based on what stakeholders like. 
Each of our team members conducted a fictional inquiry interview with different stakeholders and we used the information from two of the interviews to create our codebook and final three requirements. 

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Analysis Process:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Our team's analysis process consisted of six steps. Initial axial coding, affinity diagram, creating a codebook, axial coding with our codebook, consensus building, and requirements generation. The axial coding consisted of analyzing transcripts from our interview. 
We split into two groups consisting of Colin and Wesley, and Sho and Khizar, created an affinity diagram based on themes we saw in the transcripts, and made a consensus on each of our codebooks.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Interaction Flow:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Navigate from Buy Page to Sell Page via the profile button.</li>
                            <li>Navigate from Buy Page to Shopping Cart via the shopping cart button.</li>
                            <li>Open filters using the triangle button on the Buy Page.</li>
                            <li>Access Login Page via the “Sign in or Register” link.</li>
                        </ul>
